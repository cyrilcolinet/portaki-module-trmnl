//! The Portaki conformance battery — what every module owes the platform.

//! One test per check: the manifest validates against the schema, every surface renders with an
//! empty mock, no command or query panics on empty input, every i18n key exists in `fr` and `en`,
//! declared emails compose. `portaki publish` refuses to publish while any of them fails.
